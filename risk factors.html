      Risk factors of the coronavirus
    </h1>
    <h2><i>Older age</i></h2>
People of any age, even children, can catch COVID-19. But it most commonly affects<br>
middle-aged and older adults. The risk of developing dangerous symptoms increases <br>
with age, with those who are age 85 and older at the highest risk of serious symptoms.<br>
In the U.S., about 81% of deaths from the disease have been in people age 65 and older. Risks are even higher for older people when they have other health conditions.
Take all your medications as prescribed. Consider developing a care plan that includes <br>
    information about your medical conditions, medications, doctors' names and emergency contacts.<br>
Nursing home residents are at high risk because they often have multiple health<br>
problems, combined with advanced age. And germs can spread very easily between <br>
people who live in close proximity to each other. If you live in a nursing home, follow the<br>
guidelines to prevent infection. Ask about protection measures for residents and visitor restrictions. Let staff know if you feel ill.<br>
Older people are also more likely to have Alzheimer's disease, which can make it more <br>
difficult for them to remember the precautions recommended to prevent infection.<br>

    <h2><i>lung problems including asthma</i></h2>
    COVID-19 targets the lungs, so you're more likely to develop severe symptoms if you <br>
    already have lung problems, such as:
    <ul type="square">
      <li>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</li>
      <li>Lung cancer</li>
      <li>Cystic fibrosis</li>
      <li>Pulmonary fibrosis</li>
      <li>Moderate to severe asthma</li>
    </ul>
    While some medications for these conditions can weaken your immune system,its<br>
    important to stay on your maintenance medications to keep symptoms as controlled as <br>
    possible. You may want to talk to your doctor about obtaining an emergency supply of <br>
    prescription medications, such as asthma inhalers.<br>
    It may also help to avoid the things that make your asthma worse.<br>
    These asthma triggers can vary from person to person. Examples include pollen, dust mites, tobacco <br>
    smoke and cold air. Strong emotions and stress can trigger asthma attacks in some <br>
    people. Others are bothered by strong odors, so make sure the disinfectant you're using <br>
    isn't an asthma trigger for you.<br>
