    <h1><i><b>Get Vaccinated</b></i></h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Authorized COVID-19 vaccines can help protect you from COVID-19.</li>
     <li>You should get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as you can.</li>
<li>Once you are fully vaccinated, you may be able to start doing some things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic.</li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <h1><i><b>Wear a mask</b></i></h1>
    <ul type="circle">
   '<li> Everyone 2 years of age or older who is not fully vaccinated should wear a mask in indoor public places.</li>
      <li>In areas with high numbers of COVID-19 cases, consider wearing a mask in<br>
      crowded outdoor settings and for activities with close contact with others who are not fully vaccinated.</li>
<li>People who have a condition or are taking medications that weaken their immune <br>
    system may not be fully protected even if they are fully vaccinated. They should <br>
  continue to take all precautions recommended for unvaccinated people, including <br>
  wearing a well-fitted mask, until advised otherwise by their healthcare provider.</li>
<li>If you are fully vaccinated, to maximize protection from the Delta variant and <br>
  prevent possibly spreading it to others, wear a mask indoors in public if you are in an area of substantial or high transmission.</li>
<li>If you are fully vaccinated, see When You’ve Been Fully Vaccinated.<br>
Wearing a mask over your nose and mouth is required on planes, buses, trains, and<br> 
other forms of public transportation traveling into, within, or out of the United States and <br>
while indoors at U.S. transportation hubs such as airports and stations. Travelers are not <br>
required to wear a mask in outdoor areas of a conveyance (like on open deck areas of a <br>
ferry or the uncovered top deck of a bus).
    </ul>
<hr>
    <h1><i><b>Stay 6 feet away from others</b></i></h1>
    <ul type="square">
    <li>Inside your home: Avoid close contact with people who are sick.<br>
      If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members.</li>
      <li>Outside your home: Put 6 feet of distance between yourself and people who don’t <br>
       live in your household.</li>
      <li>Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus.</li>
      <li>Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arm lengths) from other people.</li>
<li>Keeping distance from others is especially important for people who are at <br>
  higher risk of getting very sick.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h1><i><b>Avoid crowds and poorly ventilated spaces</b></i></h1>
      <ol>
      <li>Being in crowds like in restaurants, bars, fitness centers, or movie theaters puts <br>
        you at higher risk for COVID-19.</li>
      <li>Avoid indoor spaces that do not offer fresh air from the outdoors as much as <br>
        possible.</li>
      <li>If indoors, bring in fresh air by opening windows and doors, if possible.</li>
      </ol>
      <hr>
    <h1><i><b>Wash your hands often</h1></b></i>
    <ul type="radio">
     <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially <br>
       after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or <br>
       sneezing.</li>
      <li>It’s especially important to wash:</li>

        <li>After touching animals or pets</li>
      </ol>
      <li>If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at<br>
      least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until<br>
      they feel dry.</li>
      <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h1><i><b>Cover coughs and sneezes</h1></b></i>
    <ul type="triangle">
      <li>If you are wearing a mask: You can cough or sneeze into your mask. Put on a new,<br>
        clean mask as soon as possible and wash your hands.</li>
If you are not wearing a mask:<br>

      </ol>
<li>Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap <br>
  and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that <br>
  contains at least 60% alcohol</li>
