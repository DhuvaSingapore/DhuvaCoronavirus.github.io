      About Coronavirus
    </h1>
    <center>
    Coronaviruses are a type of virus. There are many different kinds, and some <br>
    cause disease. A coronavirus identified in 2019, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a<br>
    pandemic of respiratory illness, called COVID-19.<br>

      How does the coronavirus spread?
        </b>
        </i>
    </h2>
    As of now, researchers know that the coronavirus is spread through droplets and<br>
    virus particles released into the air when an infected person breathes, talks,<br>
    laughs, sings, coughs or sneezes. Larger droplets may fall to the ground in a few<br>
    seconds, but tiny infectious particles can linger in the air and accumulate in<br>
    indoor places, especially where many people are gathered and there is poor<br>
    ventilation. This is why mask-wearing, hand hygiene and physical distancing are<br>
    essential to preventing COVID-19.<br>

        </i>
    </h2>
    The first case of COVID-19 was reported Dec. 1, 2019, and the cause was a<br>
    then-new coronavirus later named SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 may have<br>
    originated in an animal and changed (mutated) so it could cause illness in<br>
    humans. In the past, several infectious disease outbreaks have been traced to<br>
    viruses originating in birds, pigs, bats and other animals that mutated to become <br>
    dangerous to humans. Research continues, and more study may reveal how and<br>
    why the coronavirus evolved to cause pandemic disease.<br>

      How is coronavirus diagnosed?
        </b>
        </i>
    </h2>
    COVID-19 is diagnosed through a laboratory test. Diagnosis by examination <br>
    alone is difficult since many COVID-19 signs and symptoms can be caused by<br>
    other illnesses. Some people with the coronavirus do not have symptoms at all<br>

    </h2>
    Treatment for COVID-19 addresses the signs and symptoms of the infection and<br>
    supports people with more severe disease. For mild cases of coronavirus<br>
    disease, your doctor may recommend measures such as fever reducers or<br>
    over-the-counter medications. More severe cases may require hospital care,<br>
    where a patient may receive a combination of treatments that could include<br>
    steroids, oxygen, mechanical breathing support and other COVID-19 treatments<br>
    in development. Infusions of monoclonal antibodies given to certain patients early<br>
    in the infection may reduce the symptoms, severity and duration of the illness.<br>
